# AES
Implementation of AES FIPS 197 (128-bit key) encryption algorithm in C++.

This code is part of a course on cryptography and its goal was to understand how it worked.
It's made to see each step of the algorithm.

To make it work, you can simply download the aes file and compile it on your terminal (./aes command).
You can also download the whole repository and compile the code with make aes
