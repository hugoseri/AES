# AES
This repository is an implementation of AES FIPS 197 (128-bit key) encryption algorithm in C++.

### Context of this code
This code is part of a course on cryptography and its goal was to understand how it worked.  
It's made to see each step of the algorithm.  
_It isn't designed for real use._  

### How can I use it
To make it work, you can simply download the [aes file](../master/aes) and compile it on your terminal (./aes command).  
You can also download the [whole repository](https://github.com/hugoseri/AES) and compile the code with make aes (gcc compiler needed).  

### How it works
You can download [the original paper](../master/TD1_nist.fips.197.pdf) on the different detailed steps of the algorithm.
