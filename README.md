# AES
Implementation of AES FIPS 197 (128-bit key) encryption algorithm in C++.

### Context of this code
This code is part of a course on cryptography and its goal was to understand how it worked.
It's made to see each step of the algorithm.

### How can I use it
To make it work, you can simply download the aes file and compile it on your terminal (./aes command).
You can also download the whole repository and compile the code with make aes (gcc compiler needed).

### How it works
You can download TD1_nist.fips.197.pdf to get the original paper on the different detailed steps of the algorithm.
